# HOM-E , the Dashboard Companion


**_Hom-e_** is a web application built with a "mobile-first" approach, designed to help me practice coding and also to gather several apps I frequently use on my phone into one place.

## What's inside ?
_All the apps will be recreated from scratch._

1 - A shared shopping list app. Ability to create lists, edit and delete them.âœ… Now Available

2 - A shared expenses app to keep track of finances.  
3 - A shared calendar.  
4 - More features to come...

## Installation

### The application is deployed locally.

- Install XAMPP

- Place the entire "Home-Companion" folder in the HTDOCS directory.
- Create a MySQL database with two tables:
A table named _shopping_ with 3 columns: _id_, _title_, and _lists_.
A table named _users_ with the columns: _id_, _user_name_, and _user_pwd_.
- No registration form is available, so **you will need to manually create the first user** in your database.

### You can now access the application through your LocalHost.
If you need to change the connection port, go to the Config -> Mysql.php folder and enter your connection details.

This README file will be updated regularly with relevant information.
