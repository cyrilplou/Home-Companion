# HOM-E , the Dashboard Companion


**_Hom-e_** is a web application built with a "mobile-first" approach, designed to help me practice coding and also to gather several apps I frequently use on my phone into one place.

## What's inside ?
_All the apps will be recreated from scratch._

1 - A shared shopping list app. Ability to create lists, edit and delete them.  
2 - A shared expenses app to keep track of finances.  
3 - A shared calendar.  
4 - More features to come...

You can access the mockup made  on Figma via this link.

## Branches

Every App will have it own Branch on Github during dev.


This README file will be updated regularly with relevant information.
